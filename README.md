# Introduction to openBaseball
OpenBaseball is a spiritual successor to the baseball video games of the mid-1990's to early-2000's.  Examples of games that it seeks to emulate are Front Page Sports: Baseball and Microsoft Baseball 2000.  It intentionally stays away from extremem arcade style gameplay such as Ken Griffey Junior Baseball (Super NES) and Mario Super Sluggers (Nintendo Wii).  While it is a design goal to have a robust simulation engine, it is also not explicitly a managerial simulator (at least, not exclusively) like Out of the Park Baseball.
