# Introduction to openBaseball
OpenBaseball is a spiritual successor to the baseball video games of the mid-1990's to early-2000's.  Examples of games that it seeks to emulate are Front Page Sports: Baseball and Microsoft Baseball 2000.  It intentionally stays away from extremem arcade style gameplay such as Ken Griffey Junior Baseball (Super NES) and Mario Super Sluggers (Nintendo Wii).  While it is a design goal to have a robust simulation engine, it is also not explicitly a managerial simulator (at least, not exclusively) like Out of the Park Baseball.

# Maintainers
OpenBaseball is currently a private educational project but I welcome collaboration.  If you are interested in helping out, please email me at svet[dot]am [at] gmail[dot]com

# Important
Due to OpenBaseball's state in early development, most graphics resources are generated with Stable Diffusion AI.  It is the goal of this project to replace this with assets created by human artists. If you have digitial art skills and would like to contribute please reach out! (I can't draw)
